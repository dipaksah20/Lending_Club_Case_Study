## General Information
- The Lending Club is the largest market place for personal, home and different sorts of loans in a considerable lower interest rate.
- This project demonstrates the risk analysis through different driving metrics for applicants for a Lending Club through EDA Techniques.
- The analysis will work as a risk assessment for applicants applying for loan.
- Lending Club will use this to prevent financial loss or business loss.
    - If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.
    - If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
- The dataset is for the period of 2007-2011.
